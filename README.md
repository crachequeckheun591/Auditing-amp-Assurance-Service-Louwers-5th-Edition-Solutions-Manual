          * As we begin the new year, this title is currently the most up-to-date auditing textbook on the market, covering all of the latest pronouncements through the end of 2011. The book’s unique organization presents the auditing process in twelve concise chapters, with eight flexible, independent modules designed to be integrated into the course entirely at the instructor's discretion.
         
          * Perhaps most importantly, this title is the only book on the market to fully integrate the Codification of the New Clarity Standards (including new section) issued by the Auditing Standards Board. As these standards will be effective for year-end audits after December 15, 2012, they will be covered on the CPA exam beginning in July 2013, when many current students will be taking the CPA exam after completing 150 hours of coursework.
